# SignWave-Sign-Language-Interpreter-with-Live-Avatar

SignWave is an AI-powered real-time sign language interpretation system that detects hand gestures through a webcam and translates them into text and speech. It features a live animated avatar that performs the recognized signs, making communication more visual, interactive, and accessible. Designed for both learners and users of sign language, SignWave aims to bridge the communication gap between deaf/mute individuals and non-signers through accurate gesture recognition and intuitive visual feedback.
